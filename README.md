# sandpkg
Welcome to the repository for spkg (Sandboxed Packaged Manager)!

## Why spkg?
I wanted to try to integrate pip into Libterm by running the default install script,
but it does not work by itself. So, I started this repo to host packages that I modified to work in Libterm.
The main inspiration of spkg was [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash).

## What's the point of spkg?
I know that Libterm already has something like this, but before you accuse me of reinventing the wheel let me explain.
OpenTerm did not have a package manager, so I created one.
But for Libterm, there was no external repo support for its inbuilt package manager.
Thus, I created spkg to make it easier to test and pull software.
(By the way, spkg uses [this](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/sandboxrepo) repo by default.

## Installation
See the [testing](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/sandpkg/tree/testing) branch for instructions.
