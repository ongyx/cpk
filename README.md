# sandpkg
Welcome to the repository for spkg alpha.(Sandboxed Packaged Manager)!
(This is a branch for versions being tested.)

## Versions avaliable for spkg:
spkg(OpenTerm) | spkg(Libterm)
------------ | -------------
v0.11/Alpha | v25.07.19/Prerelease

## Why spkg?
I wanted to try to integrate pip into Libterm by running the default install script,
but it does not work by itself. So, I started this repo to host packages that I modified to work in Libterm.
The main inspiration of spkg was [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash).

## What's the point of spkg?
I know that Libterm already has something like this, but before you accuse me of reinventing the wheel let me explain.
OpenTerm did not have a package manager, so I created one.
But for Libterm, there was no external repo support for its inbuilt package manager.
Thus, I created spkg to make it easier to test and pull software.
(By the way, spkg uses [this](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/sandboxrepo) repository by default.)

# - Installation -

spkg was originally written for OpenTerm.
You can download the alpha release by following the instructions below.

## OpenTerm
Run these commands in your shell.

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sn3ksoftware/sandpkg/testing/openterm/sandinstall.tar.gz
tar -C ~/.scripts -zxvf sandinstall.tar.gz
sandinstall
```
(The installer is a bit buggy right now, so try running sandinstall muitiple times if it does not work the first time.)

## Libterm

Later on, spkg was rewritten for the Python-based implementation of Libterm.
~~So far, the code is ready for a prerelease, but there might be serious bugs.~~

spkg for Libterm is now [psiman](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/psiman). The code for spkg here will be kept here for archival purposes.
The installer script will problably _never_ be created for spkg on Libterm though.
(If you want, you can hack one up yourself :) )

Run this command(wip):

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sn3ksoftware/sandpkg/testing/libterm/install.py
python install.py
```

# - FAQ -
Q: I thot that Libterm has a package manager already?

A: Read the point under 'What's the point of spkg?â€™

Q: Who is spkg for?

A: CLI masters and programmers who have at least basic command-line skills.
Also, script coders who want a easier way to distribute their code.

My knowledge of Python is now advanced now, so I rewrote spkg for Libterm.
It is a lot easier to port programs over from Pythonista [for example](https://github.com/jsbain/GitHubGet), which can run without modifications, 
so reusing code is easier. (Or it can act as a reference at least.)
